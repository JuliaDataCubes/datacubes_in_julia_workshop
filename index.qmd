This is the website of the "Geospatial data cubes in Julia workshop".

In this tutorial we will explore how to analyse raster data which is larger than RAM.

## Preparation

To participate in the hands-on parts of the tutorial please install Julia on your device 
and instantiate a first environment to make sure that most Julia packages are already downloaded on your computer.

### Installation of Julia
We recommend to use the [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) installer for julia.

### Instantiation of an initial environment 
For the workshop we are going to use the environment that is available of the examples folder.
You can instantiate this environment by downloading the Project.toml file from https://github.com/JuliaDataCubes/datacubes_in_julia_workshop/blob/main/examples/Project.toml and saving it in a new folder.
Then we can start julia in this folder from the terminal and switch to the package mode by typing `]`.

We then have to first switch to the environment in the current folder by doing
```
activate .
```

And then we can download all dependencies by instantiating the environment via this command:
```
instantiate
```
