Then change in a terminal to this folder.\n\n\nUse git to download the whole workshop material.\ngit clone https://github.com/JuliaDataCubes/datacubes_in_julia_workshop/\nChange to the examples folder in the datacubes_in_julia_workshop folder.\n\n\n\nNow that we have the Project.toml file downloaded we can run the following line in the terminal from the folder in which the Project.toml is located.\njulia -e 'using Pkg;Pkg.activate(\".\");Pkg.resolve();Pkg.precompile()'\n\nThis is a Quarto website.\nTo learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites."
